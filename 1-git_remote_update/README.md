# Hi Buddies!
### My name is Waython Yesse,

* Welcome to my very first project,
  > After a long time of struggling, I eventually succeded to update my git remote from https to ssh as adviced by github themselves.
  > At first I created the ssh keys several times and add them into my github account but still I was reveiving the error!
   *  * ERROR: Permission denied (publickey)
      * fatal: Could not read from remote repository
      * Please make sure you have the correct access and the repository is exists.
* I was so disappointed, I didn't know what's wrong, I tried to ask for the helping hand from my several friends but it didn't help, the problem was still there.
* Eventually I got a solution, and today I just want to share it with you buddies, in case you are experiencing the same problem I hope it gonna help you.
